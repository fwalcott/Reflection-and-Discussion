# Top Three Important Readings 

### 1.Growth Mindset 

*I liked this reading. It put life into perspective for me. I was already on this path of wanting to learn and blossom and find more happiness and meaning. It is much easier to stay in your comfort zone and not embrace challenges, but if you don't, then you are stagnant and withering. I intrinsically knew this, but having it broken down and in writing made it easier to visualize within myself and left me with two questions I have to ask myself every day and are sometimes hard.*

***What did you accomplish today?***
***How can I improve in things I am not proud of?***

### 2.Professional Competencies 
*This article helped me assess my professional strengths and weakness. My top three professional competencies are a growth mindset, teamwork, and results. My top three areas for growth are leadership, craft, and communication. There is always room to grow and improve. This article helped me look at my competencies and see where I can improve and how to go about doing it.*
 

### 3. Mastering markdown

*This showed me a great way to make a simple HTML website with a lot less time and effort. Once you learn it, which is very simple, you can publish a page within a few minutes as long as you have your copy written and ready to go.*




***I loved the [How Computers Work Series.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-) It is concise, only thirty minutes for six videos. I learned the four things all computers do input, storage, processing, and output. I knew about circuits, CPU, Operating Systems, but I was confused about how they all went together, and this gave me a better sense of what goes on every time I click on a mouse,  type on a keyboard, or watch youtube videos.***
